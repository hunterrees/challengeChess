### Overview
***
Challenge Chess is an app for both iOS and Android. In addition to local gameplay (both two-player and against AIs), Challenge Chess supports online play with other users. Challenge Chess also has a server-based machine learning AI. As people continue to use Challenge Chess and play against the machine-learning AI, it will learn and become better.
